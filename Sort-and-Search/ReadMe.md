# SORT AND SEARCH TESTER

This folder has a main.cpp code with the following sort and search algorithms:

      - Selection Sort
      - Bubble Sort
      - Merge Sort

The algorithms use c++11 vectors and templates so they can sort and search:

      - Integers
      - Characters
      - Fractions (The class is included in the files)
      - Strings

Each algorithm is timed and the milleseconds are reported. 

## SORT
To make it easier to use there is a menu that allows the user to select random integers or 
characters or write the fractions or strings that are going to be sorted.

## SEARCH
Wait for it
